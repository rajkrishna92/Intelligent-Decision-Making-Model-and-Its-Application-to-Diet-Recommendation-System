### Research Paper: http://doi.org/10.4018/IJFSA.303563

## ABSTRACT
In the present article an effort has been made to design and develop a diet recommendation system for Metabolic Disorders patients. The key feature of this system is to recommend a menu for dinner to maintain nutritional micros as per daily requirements.The proposed intelligent decision-making system is designed as per the following phases:Under the 1st Phase, we compute the requirement of calories as per the Patient's personal information (like sex, age, height, weight), physical activity, environmental situations, and food habits on a daily basis. Under the 2nd Phase, development of knowledge base as per Patient's foods habits information. 3rd Phase is based on designing the recommendation system for a dinner menu to maintain nutritional micros as per daily requirements. The results of the system have been validated by using the Degree of match algorithm and comments of Nutritional experts. This intelligent decision making system will help the ordinary people living in urban and rural areas, especially those not aware of the nutritional value concerned with their daily food items.
